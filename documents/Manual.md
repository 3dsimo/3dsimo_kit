# 3Dsimo Kit manual

## Meaning of the display
The display has two rows with following information

1. Line 1: Material - Motor speed for the material (in %)
2. Line 2: Current temperature / Required temperature for the material  / Heating code C (Cooling), H (Heating) or R (Ready)

## Operation of the 3D Pen
The pen has 4 buttons. The base at the usb cable inlet has two buttons, the UP and DOWN button. Function is:

1. UP: switch material profile to next one. Default on switch on is PLA at 40% motor speed
2. DOWN: switch material profile to previous one. 
3. press UP and DOWN at the same time: switch display from righthanded to lefthanded, and back

One profile is 0 degrees, this is the cooldown position. The pen will not work and will go to 153 degrees

Next there are 2 buttons in the middle. These are for extrusion and retraction of the fillamenet

1. Extrude button: as long as you press the material is extruded. When you stop pressing, the filament retracts for 1second
2. Retract button: when this button is pressed, the filament is retracted for 5 seconds. Press 3 to 4 times for full retration to change filament
3. press Extrude and Retract at the same time: stop motor movement.

If a press is not recognized, press again, but not too fast after each other!

## General 3D drawing Tips
- Rest your thumb on the Extrude-Button. It is easier to operate it with the thumb, instead of the index finger.
- If some buttons behave very glitchy: Try to press them without touching the Nano pins on the bottom of the pen. If the pins annoy you: cover them with insulating tape.
- There are different firmwares available for right- and left-handed use.

### Filament loading and ejecting

- ALWAYS use filament with an even tip! Cut your strand to get one.
- You don't neccessarily need straightened filament. The bend, however, can make the loading process a bit harder.
- Let the pen heat up, then feed in the 1.75mm filament. It takes a bit of time to travel through the whole pen. Touch the filament to confirm that the motor is wired the right way. Then you can gently(!) push the filament strand in. Push until the motor grips the strand and then you can stop poushing (or push only slightly).
- Ejecting filament: Hit the Revert button and wait until the filament gets ejected. You can slightly pull the strand out. You might need to hit the button a second time. You will notice the strand getting loose, pull it out now. The tip of the filament strand is now molten and uneven. Cut it clean and right angled.
- Changing filament color: It is normal that some filament stays in the nozzle. If you change the color you will see a slow gradient from the the old to the new color. If you change the type of filament make sure to set the temperature correctly to melt the old filament first.
- Avoid to let the end of your filament string to go fully into the pen. If the motor looses grip you need to disassemble the pen to remove the filament. Never just stick another strand in!
- If your pen gets clogged: Disassemble (carefully, might be hot!), get some thin scissors to cut the filament inside the pen where it is exposed. Disassemble further. Remove all filament strands and cut it close to the nozzle. It is normal for the rest of the filament to stay inside the nozzle. 
- Place your roll of filament in a way that allows easy feeding. Make sure it does not get tight or tangled. Some people wrap it around their arm...
- It is possible for small amounts of filament to come out of the tip, even when the pen is idle. Make sure to cover the surface under your pen. If a lot of material comes out during idle: Lowering the temperature might help.

### Drawing tips

- Take your time to get a feeling for your pen and your material. Temperature and speed both change the behaviour of the material.
- With a low temperature and a steady hand you can actually draw in the air.
- ... it is, of course, easier to build up your shapes or to assemble single pieces.
- You will probably need a surface to draw on. [You can find a perfect Drawing Pad in the 3Dsimo Shop](https://3dsimo.com/eshop/kit/accessories/drawing-pad). As a makeshift surface for doodling you can even use paper, cardboard or something covered with adhesive tape. Just don't use anything that melts in high temperatures...
- You can use a transparent surface to draw "on" a sketch or template below.
- You can also use common household-items covered in adhesive tape as a base for a shape. 
- [3Dsimo offers a Silicone Pad that helps you to draw perfect circles and lines.](https://3dsimo.com/eshop/kit/accessories/silicone-drawing-pad)
- When drawing curves it is sometimes easier to rotate the surface, instead of rotating your pen and arm.
- Filament will be extruded as long as you hold the extrude button. Release the button to stop the flow. Release the button between two strokes that are not supposed to be connected.
- After you release the extrude button the motor will pull back the filament into the pen. This helps to prevent strings and hairs of material after every stroke. Make sure to hold the pen at the end of each stroke. If you pull it away before releasing the button, you will pull the material along, creating thin "hairs".
- Depending on your type of filament you might need multiple layers for a solid and stable shape.
- There are a couple of techniques to build up shapes:
  - Draw flat 2D forms and connect them at the sides.
  - Build up layers and walls. To save material you can also build up walls and ridges and then "fill" them in the air. Generally it is easiest to "ground" a line of material on already existing material.
  - Slowly drawing lines in the air.
  - Use a base shape to draw on. You can cover it with clear tape for a better grip. Make sure the material of the base is heat resistant.
- The filament cools down fairly fast after extrusion. With a bit of practice you can correct and bend it before it cools down completely.
- After you finish your piece of art, you probably need scissors or a clipper to remove thin hairs of filament. Get used to them, it's hard to avoid it completely. Alternatively you can hold the hot tip to the filament hairs to melt them away.
- Depending on your type of material you might be able to melt, bend and shape it with a hot hair dryer. e.g. you can draw a flat rectangle and bend it into a ring.
- Depending on your material you might also be able to file, clip, cut or polish the piece. Careful: Some type of filament tends to break.

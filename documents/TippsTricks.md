# Tipps and Tricks

## 3Dsimo Kit Assembly Tipps
- It should be possible to assemble the 3Dsimo KIT pen "out of the box". 
But it is still a good idea to have some tools nearby: cutter knife, soldering iron, insulating tape, small screw driver
- First read the instructions to visualize the process
- Before you start the assembly inspect and test the interlocking parts like the nozzle cover and the space for the motor. Try to fit them togehter and if you notice blocks then clean up the parts until they fit without force:
  - e.g. you might need to bend the contacts of the motor more to the side. the bottom of the motor should rest loosely on the contact of the screen
  - take extra care with the nozzle parts and the body cover. Look if the leads and contacts on the nozzle are flat enough to fit in the grove
- The nozzle cover has distinct up- and down-sides. If your cover does not line up with the rest of the body: rotate 180Â°
- Check from time to time if all boards are still nicely connected to each other.


## General 3D drawing Tipps
- Rest your thumb on the Extrude-Button. It is easier to operate it with the thumb, instead of the index finger.
- If some buttons behave very glitchy: Try to press them without touching the Nano pins on the bottom of the pen. If they annoy you: cover them with insulating tape.
- The are different firmwares available for right- and left-handed use
### Filament loading and ejecting
- ALWAYS use filament with an even tip! Cut your strand to get one.
- Let the pen heat up, then feed in the 1.75mm filament. It takes a bit of time to travel through the whole pen. Touch the filament to confirm, that the motor is wired the right way. Then you can gently(!) push the filament strand in.
- Eject filament: Hit the Revert button and wait until the filament gets ejected. You can slightly pull the strand out. You might need to hit the button a second time. You will notice the strand getting loose, pull it out now. The tip of the filament strand is now molten and uneven. Cut it clean and even.
- Changing filament color: it is normal that some filament stays in the nozzle. If you change the color you will see a slow gradient from the the old to the new color. If you change the type of filament make sure to set the temperature correctly to melt the old filament first.
- Avoid to let the end of your filament string to go fully into the pen. If the motor looses grip you need to disassemble the pen to remove the filament. Never just stick another strand in!
- If your pen gets clogged: Disassemble (careful, might be hot!), get some thin scissors to cut the filament inside the pen and to disassemble further. Remove all filament strands and cut it close to the nozzle. It is normal for the rest of the filament to stay inside the nozzle. 
- Place your roll of filament in a way that allows easy feeding. Make sure it does not get tight or tangled. Some people wrap it around their arm...
### Drawing tipps
- Take your time to get a feeling for your pen and your material. Temperature and speed both change the behaviour of the material.
- With a low temperature and a steady hand you can actually draw in the air.
- It is, of course, easier to built up your shapes or to assemble single pieces.
- You will probably need a surface to draw on. Try to find one, where the filament sticks well. You can also use clear tape as a basic surface.
- You can use a transparent surface to draw "on" a sketch or template.
- Filament will be extruded as long as you hold the extrude button. Release the button to stop the flow.
- After you release the extrude button the motor will pull back the filament into the pen. This helps to prevent strings and hairs of material after every stroke. Make sure to hold the pen at the end of each stroke. If you pull it away before releasing the button, you will pull the material along, creating thin "hairs".
- Depending on your type of filament you might need multiple layers for a solid and stable piece
- There are a couple of techniques to build up shapes:
  - Draw flat, 2D forms and connect them at tbe sides
  - Build up Layers and walls. To save material you can also build up walls and ridges and then "Fill" them in the air. Generally it is easiest to "ground" a line of material on already existing material.
  - Drawing lines in the air 
  - Use a base shape to draw on. You can cover it with clear tape for a better grip. Make sure the material of the base is fairly heat resistant.
- The filament cools down fairly fast after extrusion. With a bit of practice you can correct and bent it before it cools down completely.
- After you finish your piece of art, you probably need scissors or a clipper to remove thin hairs of filament. Get used to them, it's impossible to avoid it completely.
- Depending on your type of material you might be able to melt, bend and shape it with a hot hair dryer. e.g. you can draw a flat rectangle and bend it into a ring.
- Depending on your material you might also be able to file, clip, cut or polish the piece. Careful: Some type of filament tends to break.

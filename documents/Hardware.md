# Hardware for 3Dsimo Kit

Here you can find all the parts 3Dsimo kit is made of. The pen is based on popular Arduino Nano, it has OLED display and the cover is made from plastic parts printed on 3D printers. All the documentation can be find here and thanks to its open-source nature and available documentation every part can be easily upgraded or modified by the user.

## 3Dsimo Kit Assembly Tips
- It should be possible to assemble the 3Dsimo KIT pen "out of the box". 
But it is still a good idea to have some tools nearby: cutter knife, soldering iron, insulating tape, small screw driver.
- First read the entire instructions to visualize the process.
- Before you start the assembly: Inspect and test the interlocking parts like the nozzle cover and the space for the motor. Try to fit them together one by one and if you notice blocks then clean up the parts until they fit without force:
  - e.g. You might need to bend the contacts of the motor more to the side. The bottom of the motor should rest loosely on the contact of the screen.
  - Take extra care with the nozzle parts and the body cover. Look if the leads and contacts on the nozzle are flat enough to fit in the grove.
- The nozzle cover has distinct up- and down-sides. If your cover does not line up with the rest of the body: rotate 180Â°.
- The nozzle itself can slide forward and backward on the contacts. Adjust it for best fit. You probably need to bend the contacts slightly until they line up good.
- Check from time to time if all boards are still nicely connected to each other.
- If your motor moves the wrong way: Rotate the plug.

# 3D print
Plastic parts of 3Dsimo KIT are printed on FDM printers and can be easily swapped. We intend to add new parts and new designs all the time. All 3D models are of course available, so you can modify them as you please. IF you have an interesting model don't hesitate to share it with us.

### 3D models folder
You can find all 3D models of the parts in [this Folder: 3dsimo_kit/3Dmodels/](../3Dmodels/)

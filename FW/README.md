## Firmware for the 3Dsimo KIT

In this (sub-)folder you can find the source files (Arduino "sketches") to update and modify the code of the 3Dsimo KIT pen.

### Firmware Flashing Guide

[Here is a step by step guide that explains how to set up the Arduino IDE with 3Dsimo KIT](https://github.com/3dsimo/3dsimo_kit/blob/master/documents/pdf/HW_FW_manualEN.pdf). 
The data on the 3Dsimo KIT will be overwritten in the flashing process. But you can always do a "factory reset" by uploading the code from the subfolder 3dsimo_kit/FW/3DsimoKit/ to your pen.

You will need:
- [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [One of those .ino files](https://github.com/3dsimo/3dsimo_kit/tree/master/FW/3DsimoKit)
